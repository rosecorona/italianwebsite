            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>Since our opening in the heart of Washington, D.C., Corona's Italian Dining has been dedicated to serving authentic Italian cuisine with a commitment to using only homemade flavorings. Our story began with a passion for the rich, robust flavors of Italy and a dream to share them with the world. It's a story of family, tradition, and the love of good food.</p>
            <p>From our signature homemade pasta sauces to the hand-tossed dough of our pizzas, each dish is a testament to our heritage. We invite you to step into our home and savor the taste of Italy, right here in D.C. Enjoy the homemade difference, where every meal is a celebration of flavor and family.</p>
